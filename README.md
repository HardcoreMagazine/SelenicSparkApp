Write cool stuff in here :P

TODO:
- ~~Fix "change username" for users~~
- ~~Add "usernameChangeTokens" to migration & DB, integrate it inside user settings~~
- Add warning-ban-usernameChangeTokens in Admin panel user management
- Add role manger in Admin panel + protection to admin, moderator, user roles.
- Fix/show msg for users w/o confirmed email instead of "Invalid login" on login page
- Build feed and post view ground-up
- Add moderator tools for user's posts

OPTIONAL TODO:
- and secondary objectives (optional) would be:
- Adding SEARCH for Admin panel's Users page (user database index)
- Adding pages to said User's page so it wont display whole database of users to poor single admin
